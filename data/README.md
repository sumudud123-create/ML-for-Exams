 Ethical Data Access and Confidentiality Statement

This research project, *“Machine Learning for Question Paper Generation,”* utilizes both official and open-access educational datasets.  
All national and provincial examination papers are obtained under authorized data-sharing agreements with relevant educational authorities and are stored in encrypted local drives that are not uploaded to this repository.

Only synthetic or publicly available datasets (e.g., the SciQ dataset from AllenAI) are included in this GitHub repository for demonstration and reproducibility.  
All confidential examination data remain private and are used solely for model development and evaluation within approved ethical guidelines.

Any external user who wishes to reproduce this work should refer to the open datasets listed in `docs/data_sources.md` and follow the instructions in `data/README.md` to replicate experiments ethically.
